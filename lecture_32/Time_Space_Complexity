Time and Space Complexity

TLE -> Time limit exceed

Time and Space complexity is hardware independent. There is no involvement of system there.
It is only depends on algorithm and input size of the program.

For Example :: 
		
		System.currentTimeMillis() -> give the time of the system. It is the default inbuilt function with a return type of long.
		
		long start = System.currentTimeMillis();			|-> This gives the start time before the execution of the loop
		for(int i = 0; i<1000_00; i++) {
			
		}
		long end = System.currentTimeMillis();				|-> This gives the end time after the execution of the loop
		
	
		System.out.println(end - start);					|-> This will give the time required for the loop to run.
		
		

Asymptotic Notation ::
 
-> Worst Case (Big Oh -> O)
-> Best Case  (Omega Notation -> Î©)

When Interviewer ask what is tightly Upper-Bound ??
When there are various solution for the same code. We donot compare with each of the graphs,
Rather we compare to the tightly upper-bound. 
Tightly upper-bound -> The one closest to our graph, we compare with that graph, It is called tightly upper bound
